    <h1> List of 5 programming quotes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.</li>
        <li> Talk is cheap. Show me the code.</li>
        <li>Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but it is fun to program.</li>
        <li> When someone says, “I want a programming language in which I need only say what I want done,” give him a lollipop.</li>
        <li>Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.</li>
    </ul>
